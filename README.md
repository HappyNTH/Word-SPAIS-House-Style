# Installation & use
1. Download or clone the repository to `%appdata%/Roaming/Microsoft/Bibliography/Style`
2. Select `Harvard - SPAIS House Style` as your `Style` within the `References` top-bar

# A Note of Caution
Word's bibliography definition documents (like this one) are filled with provisions for lots of edge-cases. I will attempt to identify and correct these as I encounter them, but I can give no guarentee it will always produce the right result. Please double-check, and if you notice something wrong you can submit an issue: I'll try and keep things up-to-date as best I can! Unfortunately the SPAIS style guide is itself inconsistent in places, so in general I'm taking the path of least resistance if something is contradictory.
